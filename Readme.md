# 🐹 DSA in Go

I’m restarting my **DSA journey in Golang**.  
I already know DSA, but I thought it would be fun to revisit problems while learning Go and building everything from scratch.

## 📌 What’s inside?
- Data Structures implemented in Go
- Common DSA problems
- Unit tests for each problem

## 🤝 Contributing
If you’re also learning Go, feel free to contribute!  
The best way to get started is by **adding or improving test cases**.  
This way, we can practice both **DSA and Go testing** together 🚀

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo:
